Iemayyin is a small to medium sized town north of Navgiari City and connected to it by Navgiari Road 1 which leaves from its south.
The city is not surrounded by walls like many others in Navgiari because monster attacks are almost unheard of anywhere near the peaceful settlement.
The player's house is in the southwest of the town, which is mostly divided into three sections:
Southwest residential area:
  There are three houses in a north-south row.
  The player's house is the southernmost one, and its front door is just a few steps away from Navgiari Road 1.
  // TODO: the other two houses are occupied by ppl. In the southeast is the commercial district. The northwest and northeast are occupied by the library and town hall.
